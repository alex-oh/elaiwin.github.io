              <p>As I started riding my road bike more and more in high school, I gained an interest in high-end carbon fiber road racing bikes.  At the time, the main focus of the performance bike industry was to make bikes as light as possible.  I realized that the advantage of using carbon fiber was not soley in its material properties, but also the ability to design and manufacture structues in a completely new way.  I researched different materials and methods including wet layup or preimpregnated carbon fiber, using a combination of molds, plugs, heat, and pressure.  From this research, I realized it may be feasible to build my own.  Because I was essentially starting from scratch, I had no idea how many and in what orientation I should be using the sheets.  I made approximations using the tensile strength of the carbon fiber and epoxy provided in their datasheets, but did not model the layers and perform FEA using software.  I designed the layup based on forces and moments determined from FEA of a model with circular tubes and isotropic properties (steel) and intuition of the carbon fiber's anisotropic properties.  This was quite risky, but I decided to build the frame anyways and test its strength afterwards.

                    <p> I machined metal inserts for the head tube and bottom bracket, and bought metal dropouts for the rear wheel.  I used insulation foam for the core of each tube which I shaped by hand.
