          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">

                  <p> For my mechanical engineering senior design project, my group members and I are developing a autonomous robot for making deliveries in multistory buildings.  Packages can be loaded onto the robot on the ground floor, and the robot will call the elevator, select the correct floor, exit the elevator on that floor and unload the packge to a designated area.  We envision the robot being deployed in places such as apartment complexes and office buildings.</p>
                  <p> Given very few constraints on the subjec of our project, we came up with a list of possible issues that could be solved with an electromechanical device or robot.  Some ideas included a dinner table setting robot, a dehydrator/compactor trash bin combo, and an anti-lock braking system for bicycles.  We decided on our delivery robot as it gives us the chance to research and implement mechanical, electrical, and software design.  We plan to use a combination of camera and ultrasonic sensor for vision and sensing, a solenoid attached to a belt system for button pressing, and a four-bar unloader, all mounted on a holonomic mecanum wheel chassis </p>
                  <p> As our team lead, I broke up the project into specific phases and tasks within those phases.  I created a timeline for each task and assigned each to a team member.  I was in charge of designing and manufacturing our driving chassis, as well as writing our vision software and programming motor control and the robots logic.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
              <p>Initially, the 3 wheeled design was created and further developed until I learned that the included screws did not fit the motor casing.  The second design was then created to integrate the motor mount into the chasis to simplify printing and assembly.  All the provided components were measured and then modeled in SolidWorks.  The wheels and chasis were modeled accounting for allowances in the clearance and press fits and printer precision.</p>

              <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/assembly.png"></p>
            <p>The entire car was modeled, then combined in an assembly.  Two wheel sizes were created to see which would be faster when mounted on the driving axle.  The parts were printed on an Ultimaker 3 using purple PLA filament.  The motor mount required a little sanding to prevent the chasis from deflecting too much in the rear.  Rubberbands were wrapped around the wheels to increase the traction.  The cars were tested in the afternoon on a day with moderate sun as it was beginning to set.  The fully assembled car weighed 60g and travelled the 20ft distance in 7.53s, the fastest times of any of the cars tested.</p>
